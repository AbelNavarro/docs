### Export Calendar on Job Definition

When you export a job that is associated with a calendar, the job definition will add the list of saved calendars.

When you import the job on another rundeck instance or project, if an existing project calendar doesn’t match with the calendar name, a warning will be displayed. Otherwise, the calendar will be updating adding the new job to its job list.
