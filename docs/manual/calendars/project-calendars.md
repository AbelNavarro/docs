# Project Calendars

You can also add calendars at project level. You will find a new menu on the project sidebar:

![Project Calendars](~@assets/img/calendars-project-home.png)

When you click **Add Calendar**, the form has the same structure as the [System Calendars](/manual/calendars/system-calendars.md), the only difference is the calendar will be applied for the project or for a selected list of jobs within the Project.

Now you will see a new section called **Jobs** where you can define where the calendar will be used. By default, it will be used for all jobs on the project.

You can change that behaviour unselected the "Apply this Calendar to All Jobs" checkbox. Then you will see a button where you can select which jobs will be related with the calendar.


![Add a Job](~@assets/img/calendars-project-add-job-button.png)

Click "Add a Job..."

![Job Detail](~@assets/img/calendars-project-jobs-selector.png)

Click on a Job name.


![Job Selected](~@assets/img/calendars-project-jobs-selected.png)


Also, you can remove jobs from the list clicking "Remove".

Save the Calendar.

Then, in the Jobs page you will see the list of calendars applied to the Job's schedule:
