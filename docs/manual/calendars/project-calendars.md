You can also add calendars at project level. You will find a new menu on the project menu:

`Add Calendar` form has the same structure than the system calendar, the only difference is the calendar will be applied for the project in particular or for a selected list of jobs.

Now you will see a new tabs call “Jobs” where you can define where the calendar will be used. By default, it will be used for all jobs on the project.

You can change that behaviour unselected the “Apply All Jobs” checkbox. Then you will see a button where you can select which jobs will be related with the calendar.
